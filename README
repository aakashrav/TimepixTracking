The code here is what is allowed to be made publicly available - the rest of the code is proprietary to the Institute of Experimental and Applied Physics in Prague.

The subatomic particle detectors Timepix and Medipix produce images corresponding to energy deposits created by different particles that hit them; however these images are noisy with electromagnetic noise produced by “delta rays” or “delta electrons”. The goal is to produce a series of steps that will help separate the particle “core” from the delta electrons, thus enabling various analyses by comparing the size and average energy values of the particle core vs those of the delta electrons.
